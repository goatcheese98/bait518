## 📝 Next Development Steps

### Phase 1: Implement Remaining Charts (2-3 hours)
1. Copy the pattern from `Chart1TimeSeriesWages.vue`
2. Update fetch URL to load appropriate CSV file
3. Process data in `processData()` function
4. Configure `chartOption` with your chart settings
5. Test and refine

### Phase 2: Style & Polish (1 hour)
1. Adjust colors for consistency
2. Add annotations to highlight insights
3. Refine titles and labels
4. Test navigation flow

### Phase 3: Prepare Presentation (1 hour)
1. Take screenshots of each chart
2. Create PowerPoint backup slides
3. Write speaker notes
4. Practice 7-minute presentation

**Total estimated time**: 4-5 hours

## 💡 Tips for Success

### For Development
- **Start simple**: Get Charts 2-5 working with basic data first
- **Test frequently**: Check browser console for errors
- **Use Chart 1 as template**: Copy its structure for other charts
- **Commit often**: Use git to save your progress

### For Presentation
- **Focus on insights**: Don't just describe the chart, tell what it means
- **Keep it simple**: 2-3 key points per chart
- **Practice navigation**: Know how to quickly move between slides
- **Have backup**: Screenshots in PowerPoint in case live demo fails
- **Time yourself**: 7 minutes is shorter than you think!

### For Screenshots
- Use full-screen mode (F11 in browser)
- Capture at 1920x1080 resolution
- Screenshot just the chart area (white background)
- Save as PNG for best quality
