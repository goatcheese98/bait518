## Tips for Efficiency

1. **Focus on Charts 2-4 first** - These are simpler to implement
2. **Reuse Chart 1 code** - Copy the data loading pattern
3. **Test incrementally** - Don't wait until all charts are done
4. **Use placeholders** - If stuck, use mock data to keep moving
5. **Time box tasks** - Don't spend more than 1 hour on any single chart
6. **Ask for help early** - Don't struggle alone for too long

---

## Emergency Backup Plan

If running short on time:

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- Chart 1 ‚úÖ Already done
- Chart 2 (Geographic) - **Priority 1**
- Chart 4 (COLA) - **Priority 2**
- Charts 3 & 5 can use placeholder data if needed

### Quick Wins
- Focus on getting 3-4 charts working with real data
- Use placeholder data for remaining charts
- Take screenshots of working charts
- Prepare solid talking points for what you have

## Questions to Answer During Development

As you build each chart, ask yourself:

1. **What insight does this chart reveal?**
2. **Is the data accurate and correctly displayed?**
3. **Are the labels clear and readable?**
4. **Does the chart tell a story?**
5. **What will I say during the presentation?**
